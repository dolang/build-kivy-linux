* Build manylinux2010 docker images
This should be straight-forward, there's already a build script in the
repository's master branch.  Just run:

: ~/dev1/manylinux2010/build-images.sh

*Note:* that script has to modify a Dockerfile from the repository,
you may want to reset those changes afterwards.  The script itself
contains an explanation.

* If you're new to Docker...
- It's probably best to familiarise yourself with Docker beforehand
  and do the [[https://docs.docker.com/get-started/][tutorials]], they're quite good.
- However, if you're just interested in the produced manylinux2010
  images, the following two commands are an easy way to get some
  status information (the second may take a while):
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh  :results drawer
    docker image ls
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh  :results drawer
    # docker container ls -as
    # or short:
    docker ps -as
  #+END_SRC

- To free space after builds, you can remove obsolete images with
  ~docker image rm <name-or-id>~ and containers with ~docker rm
  <name-or-id>~.  Tab-completion is supported, too.
