* Build manylinux2010 docker images
This should be straight-forward, there's already a build script in the
repository's master branch.  Just run:

: ~/dev1/manylinux2010/build-images.sh

*Note:* that script has to modify a Dockerfile from the repository,
you may want to reset those changes afterwards.  The script itself
contains an explanation.

* About the images
Three images are produced by the build script.  The one which ends in
=_centos-6.9-no-vsyscall= serves only as a dependency for the =x86_64=
variant [fn:1].  The Docker images =manylinux2010_i686= and
=manylinux2010_x86_64= have the necessary environment to produce
compatible wheels and contain CPython interpreters for v2.7, v3.3, v3.4,
v3.5 and v3.6 [fn:2].  These are installed in =/opt/python/= subfolders.

Due to technical restrictions they are not suited to compile binaries
which depend on the most recent C++ standards [fn:3].

* If you're new to Docker
- It's probably best to familiarise yourself with Docker and work
  through the [[https://docs.docker.com/get-started/][tutorials]].  They are quite good.
- However, if you're just interested in the produced manylinux2010
  images, the following two commands are an easy way to get some
  status information (the second may take a short while):
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh  :results drawer
    docker image ls
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh  :results drawer
    # docker container ls -as
    # or short:
    docker ps -as
  #+END_SRC

- To free space after builds, you can remove obsolete images with
  ~docker image rm <name-or-id>~ and containers with ~docker rm
  <name-or-id>~.  Tab-completion is supported, too.


* Footnotes

[fn:1] See [[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/#compatibility-with-kernels-that-lack-vsyscall][this section in PEP 571]] for a detailed explanation on why
this is necessary.

[fn:2] Note: =manylinux2010/docker/build_scripts/build_env.sh= contains
more detailed version information.  v3.3 is outdated and will soon be
removed, while v3.7 is due to be released in a few months' time.

[fn:3] The original pull request from [[https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/pull/152][markrwilliams:manylinux2]]  has
a discussion/a few pointers on why that is the case.
