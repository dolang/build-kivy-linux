* TODO Backports
- *WIP*
- I'll need to derive proper scripts from my notes so you'll be able
  to build the packages from source RPMs (SRPM) yourself.
- In the meantime, I've put the RPMs I've compiled on my own machine
  into the expected directory. (Insert warning about random dude's
  binaries here.)
- Head straight to step 3.  /Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200./
